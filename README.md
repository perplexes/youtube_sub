# Youtube Sub! Download your subscribed youtube videos with ease.

So you're all like, hey, I'm subscribed to all these awesome Starcraft II commentary videos on youtube, but it's a pain having to watch them in the browser with all that non-starcraft chrome and such.

Isn't there some script that will just scrape the RSS feed and download the videos for me? I have an extra 100GB just lying around!

Well, you've come to the right place.

## Usage

Download somewheres and run:

    ruby youtube_sub.rb <username>
    
Where &lt;username&gt; is your youtube user name, like mine is colincurtin.
